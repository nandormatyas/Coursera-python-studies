# Python-studies
This repository includes the code written following the
[Python for Everybody Specialization course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python),
accomplished in 2017. This was my very first approach towards coding, I was completely unaware of clean code directives,
please view code accordingly.

The first part, learning the basics, was written in python2.

The second part was written in python3:

- [Expressions](https://github.com/nandormatyas/python-studies/tree/master/0_2expressions)
